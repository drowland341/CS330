CS330 Coursework

When I approach designing software, I start by thoroughly understanding the requirements and end goals of the project. For this 3D graphics project, I began by analyzing the 2D image to be replicated in a 3D space. I started to get an idea of the shapes and textures needed and planned the scene layout accordingly. I knew I wanted just a rough shape to start and then I would modify and add shapes to further enhance it. This project improved my ability to deconstruct real-world objects into basic forms that can be recreated digitally. 

Through this project, I developed new design skills, particularly in applying textures and materials to basic shapes to add realism to the scene. I also gained a deeper understanding of lighting and how it affects the perception of depth and texture in a 3D environment. The project taught me the importance of maintaining simplicity while designing complex scenes by using basic geometric primitives, ensuring the scene remained manageable and efficient to render.

I followed an iterative design process, starting with a basic sketch of the 3D scene based on the 2D image. I then selected and positioned basic shapes to represent objects and tested different textures and materials to achieve the desired realism. With each iteration, I refined these elements based on feedback and self-assessment to ensure the final product was polished and met project requirements.

The tactics from my design approach, such as iterative development, modular design, and breaking down complex problems into simpler components, can be applied in future work, particularly in large-scale software projects where clarity and manageability are essential. By focusing on incremental improvements and continuous testing, I can ensure reliable and scalable software design, whether for graphics applications or other domains.

My approach to developing programs involves a clear understanding of the problem domain and planning the structure before coding. For the 3D scene, I used incremental development, starting with simple shapes and gradually adding complexity through textures, materials, and lighting. I utilized a modular programming style to keep the codebase organized and manageable, ensuring that each function and class had a clear responsibility.

While working on my 3D scene, I employed strategies like focusing on optimization techniques to manage rendering performance and memory usage effectively. I also integrated continuous testing throughout the development process, allowing me to catch and resolve issues early. Using OpenGL and GLSL shaders was a new experience, requiring me to adapt my usual development practices to these tools' specificities.

Iteration was a key factor in my development process. Each milestone allowed me to build upon the previous work incrementally. This iterative process not only helped refine the final output but also facilitated a deeper understanding of each component's role within the 3D environment.

Throughout the milestones, my approach evolved from focusing on individual components to understanding the holistic view of the entire scene. This broader perspective enabled me to create a more cohesive and polished final product.

Computer science provides the foundational skills necessary for understanding and solving complex problems, which is invaluable in any field I choose to pursue. The principles learned in computational graphics, such as optimization, problem decomposition, and algorithmic thinking, are applicable in various domains, from software engineering to data analysis. In the future, I may even decide to create my own video game and all of this foundational knowledge will be of great help.

Computational graphics and visualizations have broadened my understanding of how digital tools can represent and manipulate real-world objects and environments. This knowledge is not only for graphics programming but also for fields like virtual reality, game development, and simulation. It has definitely sparked an interest in exploring more advanced topics such as procedural generation and machine learning applications in graphics.

The skills gained in computational graphics and visualizations, such as attention to detail, understanding of spatial relationships, and proficiency in graphics APIs like OpenGL, are directly applicable to careers in game development, simulation, and any field requiring 3D modeling. These skills also enhance my ability to create compelling visual presentations and simulations, which are valuable in industries ranging from entertainment to scientific research.
